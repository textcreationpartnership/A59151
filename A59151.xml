            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving obſerved for ſeveral Years, that there hath been a great want of a Piece of <hi>Sea-Gunnery,</hi> that has been principally adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Sea-Service, in a Treatiſe by it ſelf; (for thoſe Books that were Extant, were chiefly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for Land Service;) and at this time moſt of them being out of Print, I judg'd this a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for the publiſhing this ſmall Treatiſe, hoping it will be gratefully accepted by our <hi>Sea-Gunners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in regard that thoſe who would be Students in that Art, ought (in ſome competent meaſure) to be acquainted with Arithmetick; for the ſake of ſuch, I have exhibited two Compendiums thereof, one in Vulgar, and the other in Decimal Arithmetick, as a neceſſary preparation for the working thoſe Queſtions that are incident to that Art.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:61990:4"/>
            <p>And for the eaſe of ſuch as are not fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith, I have furniſhed them with a Proportional Scale, whereby they may perform all the Operations that are uſeful in Gunnery; as alſo, to extract the Square and Cube-Roots, and how to perform the ſame by Logarithms, and by <hi>Gunter's-Scale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I have added ſeveral neceſſary Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles uſeful in <hi>Gunnery,</hi> with proper Questions and their Anſwers, and uſeful Obſervations and Instructions,</p>
            <p>And for the better accompliſhing the Deſign of this Book, I have conſulted with the beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Authors, that have written on this Subject.</p>
            <p>Alſo at the end of this Treatiſe, I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented you with a ſmall Tract as an Appendix, particularly of the uſe of the Proportional Scale; and of the uſe of a Rule of a new contrivance, fit for the Pocket, that hath upon it, an Epitome of the Practical part of <hi>Gunnery</hi> in it ſelf, which I call the <hi>Sea-Gunner's Rule:</hi> All which I ſubmit to the favourable construction of the Judicious,</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. THE EXTRACTION OF THE Square Root.</head>
               <p>THe Extraction of the Square Root is that by which having a number gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, another number may be found, which being Multiplied by itſelf, produceth the number required.</p>
               <p>Any Square number being given to be Extracted, thus it may be prepared. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Rule, put a Point over the firſt place thereof to the Right hand (being the place of Unites;) then proceeding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left hand, paſs over the ſecond place, and put a Point over the third place;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61990:37"/>alſo paſſing over the Fourth place, put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Point over the Fifth, and ſo forward in ſuch manner, that between every Two Points which are next one to another; ſo that one place may be intermitted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Example, 630436. Suppoſe the Square Root of this Number be required; the Firſt Point is to be placed over 6, and the Second over 4, and ſo of the reſt as you ſee in the Example; and note, that as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Points as are placed in that manner, of ſo many Figures will the Root be.</p>
               <p>To fit it for operation, draw a crooked Line on the Right hand of the Number propounded for Extraction, then find the Root of the Firſt Square, and place it in the Quotient, which in this Example is found to be 7; <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Then Square the Quotient which is 49, and place it under the firſt Square of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61990:38"/>given, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 63, and Subtract the 49 from the Firſt Square; and place the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder orderly underneath the Line, which is 14, to which Remainder being down, the next Squares of the Number propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and place them on the Right hand of the ſaid Remainder; (and may now be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Reſolvend.) Then double the Root, being the Number placed in the Quotient, which is 14, and place them on the Left hand of the Reſolvend (like a Diviſor,) parted off with a Crooked Line.</p>
               <p>Then demand how often that Diviſor is contained in the Reſolvend, which may be now called the Dividend (proceeding in all reſpects as you do in Diviſion,) and write the anſwer in the Quotient on the Right hand of the Diviſor; then if you ask how often the Diviſor 149 is found in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend 1404, the Anſwer is 9 times: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore write 9 in the Quotient, and alſo after the Diviſor 14.</p>
               <p>Then Multiply all the Numbers which ſtand on the Left hand of the Reſolvend, <hi>viz.</hi> (before the Crooked Line,) and write the Product orderly underneath the Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vend; then having drawn a Line under the ſaid Product, ſubtract it from the Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vend, and ſubſcribe the Remainder under the Line which is 63: unto which Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61990:38"/>bring down the remaining Figures of the Reſolvend, and then there will be 6336 at the Left hand, of which number draw another Crooked Line; then double the Quotient, which is 158, and ſet it on the Left hand of the ſaid Crooked Line; then demand how often you may have 158 in 633: the Anſwer is 4, which 4 muſt be placed in the Quotient; then multiply that by each Figure of the Diviſor, and ſubſcribe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct orderly under the Dividend, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it therefrom, and there remains 16; ſo the work is finiſhed, and the Square Root of that Number 630436 is 794, and 16 which remains, intimates that the Root is ſomething greater than 794, but leſs than 795; yet how much greater than 794 is not yet diſcovered by any Rules of Art. But farther Progreſs may be made for a nearer diſcovery of the truth; but in this caſe it being but a ſmall difference, I ſhall wave it.</p>

                  <p>Which done, draw a Crooked Line on the Right hand of the Number to ſignify a Quotient; then find the Cube Root of the Firſt Cube which is 1, as you may ſee in the Table, which 1 ſet in the Quotient. Then ſubſcribe the Cube of the Root placed in the Quotient, under the Firſt Cube of the Number given, which in this Example is 1.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61990:41"/>
                  <p>Then draw a Line under the Cube ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed aforeſaid, and ſubtract this Cube from the Firſt Cube, and place the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder orderly underneath the Line, which in this Example is nothing; to which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, bring down the ne x Cube, which is 728, placing it on the Right hand of the Remainder, which number ſo placed, may be called the Reſolvend; having drawn a Line underneath the Reſolvend, Square the Root in the Quotient, that is, multiply it in itſelf, and ſubſcribe 3 the Triple of the ſaid Square or Product under the Reſolvend, and place it under 7, the place of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds.</p>
                  <p>Then Triple the Root or Number in the Quotient, which is 3, and ſubſcribe this Triple Number in ſuch a manner, that the Firſt place thereof, (the place of Unites,) may ſtand under the Second place, (the place of Tens) in the Reſolvend, which Triple is Three which I place under 2: Then the Triple Square of the Root, and the Triple of the Root being ſo placed, draw a Line under them, and add them together, the Sum is 33 for a Diviſor.</p>
                  <p>Then let the whole Reſolvend, except the Firſt place thereof towards the Right hand, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the place of Unites, be eſteemed as a Dividend; then demanding how often

                  <p>Then draw another Line under the work, and multiply the Triple Square before ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed (under 7) by the laſt Figure placed in the Quotient, which is 2, and ſay, 2 times 3 is 6; which Product I ſubſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſaid Triple Square <hi>(viz.)</hi> under the 3, which ſtands under the 7, as you may ſee in the work.</p>
                  <p>Then Multiply the Figure laſt placed in the Quotient, namely 2, by the Triple Number before ſubſcribed under 2 in the Reſolvend; for 2 being multiplied by it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, produceth 4, which being multiplied by the Triple Number 3, the Product is 12, which I ſubſcribe with the 1 under 6, and the 2 under 3; as in the work may appear.</p>
                  <p>Then Cube the laſt Figure in the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient which is 8, which place in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it may ſtand under the place of Unites in the Reſolvend, as you may ſee in the work.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, Thoſe that are Extraordinary Pieces, are called <hi>Double Fortified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fortification is reckoned by the thickneſs of the Metal at the Touch-hole, at the Trunnions, and at the Muzzle, in proportion to the Diameter of the Bore.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. Neceſſary Instructions for a Sea-Gunner.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE Firſt thing is, that when a Gunner cometh into a new Ship, that he diligently and carefully meaſure his Guns, to know they are full fortified, be reinforced or leſſened in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then he muſt with a Ladle and Spunge, draw and make clean all his Guns within, that there may be no old Powder, Stones, Iron, or any thing that may do harm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he ſearch all the Guns within, to ſee if they are taper Chamber'd, or true bored, or whether they be Crack'd, Flaw'd, or Honey comb'd within; and finding what Ball ſhe ſhoots, to mark the Weight of the Ball over the Port; that thereby he may
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61990:92"/>ſee the Mark or Number upon the Carriage and Caſe; ſo that in time of ſervice they may not go wrong.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Guns being dimenſioned and clean as aforeſaid, take half a Ladle of Powder for every Gnn, and blow them off, ſpunge them well; and finding them clean, you may load them with their reſpective Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges and Powder, they being ramm'd home with a ſtrait Wadd after it.</p>
               <p>Then let the Ball role home to the Wadd, and ſet a Wadd cloſe home to the Ball, that the Ball may not roul out with the motion and tumbling of the Ship.</p>
               <p>Then muſt you Tomkin that Piece at the Muzzle, with a wooden Tomkin, which you muſt tallow round about, to preſerve the Powder from wetting.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe make a little Tapon of Ockam for the Touch-hole, which muſt be tallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo, to prevent any wet coming to the Powder that way; then let your leaden A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pron be put over it; then make your Piece faſt, as occaſion preſents.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Piece being loaded and faſt, then provide to every Piece 24 Cartridges at leaſt, ready made; that is to ſay, 12 fill'd, and 12 empty.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe you muſt be careful, ſo long as the Gunner's Crew are buſie with the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61990:92"/>that there be no burning Match or Fire in the Ship; Alſo to lay his Cartridges in Barrels or Cheſts, that when there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to uſe them, they may be without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Gunner muſt ſee that he ſorts his Ball very well, and lay every ſort by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſeveral Caſes; and upon every Caſe ſet the Weight of one of the Shot, which is in them.</p>
               <p>Alſo you ought to make the Bags for Hail for the Guns above, and fill them with Stones, ſmall Shot, or Pieces of old Iron, which may be a great annoyance to the Enemies Men.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If it falls out that any new Ports muſt be cut out in the Ship, you muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that it be made over a Beam, or as near one as poſſible you can; Alſo that they be not higher or lower than the Ports be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; likewiſe that there be room for the Guns to play, becauſe if one Gun be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, there might be another brought to her place: And obſerve that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſtand on her Trucks. The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt part of the Carriage muſt ſtand in the middle of the Port, up and down, that a Man may lay his Piece as you pleaſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. You muſt be careful that the Powder in the Powder-Room be well covered
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61990:93"/>with Hides: And alſo that the Ropes, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and Spunges be ready at hand. And you muſt not let the Powder be unturned above a Month, becauſe the Salt-Petre will be apt to ſink to the lower part of the Barrel, which would be dangerous to make uſe of that Powder; And you muſt every Month draw your Guns; if you think they have got any wetneſs or moiſture in the Powder; Alſo for fear of the Salt Petre diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, which may prejudice the Piece. You muſt alſo be careful of the Candle and Fire about the Gun Room, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Powder Room, that there may come no diſafter.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe a Gunner muſt keep a good Account of all Materials that belong to the Guns, as Ball, Match, and Powder. What part thereof he ſpends, alſo what remains.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A Gunner muſt uſe all diligence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they engage with an Enemy, to ſet a Barrel of Water betwixt every two Guns, that when they have conveniency they may dip the Spunges for the cooling of the Guns, and for fear of Fire remaining in the Piece, which may do hurt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Alſo you muſt be ſure that there be no melted Fire-works done in the Ship, but aſhore; for it is dangerous, and a great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to the Ship, and Goods; and Men's Lives may thereby be deſtroyed.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:61990:93"/>
               <p>Alſo that in time of ſervice, no Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works be brought up in the Round-houſe, or great Cabbin, to ſtand, for fear of Shot coming from the Enemy may fire it, and ſo deſtroy the Ship. But rather to have them kept below in the Powder-Room, or Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard-Room, to prevent Danger.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Neceſſaries that a Gunner ought to have for his Ordnance, and the quantity thereof according to the Length of the Voyage, the Quantity and Quality of his Guns.</p>
               <p>Alſo if you go in a Man of War, or a Merchant-man, then there is difference of Proviſions; only I will here name them all that belong to a Sea Gunner, that he may take ſuch a Proportion of each, as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſion may require, and at the End of the Voyage to give an Account what Stores are ſpent, and what there is yet remaining.</p>

               <p>FIrſt take the Diameter of the Piece upon the thickeſt Part, at the Breech of the Gun, with a Pair of Callaber Compaſſes, and ſee upon the Quadrant of your Callabers, how many Inches that is; the half of which Diameter take between a Pair of Compaſſes, and put that diſtance off upon a Sheet of Cartridge-Paper, which will make two Points upon the Paper, as A and B; then take the Diameter of the thickeſt part with your Callabers, and ſee how many Inches that Diameter is, And take the half thereof between your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, and ſet one Foot in A, and the other Point in C upon the ſaid Line AB, at C.</p>

               <p>Then take the Diſtance from C, to B, on the Line, and that is the true Diſpart of the Piece; and if you take a Stick or Straw of that length, and ſet on the Muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle faſtned with Wax, it will be a true Diſpart for that Piece.</p>

               <p>TO ſhoot Point-Blank is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that when the Cylender of the Piece lyeth level with the Horizon, ſo that the Ruler of the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Quadrant being put into the Mouth of the Piece, the Line and Plummet hangeth Perpendicular, then that Piece lyeth in its true Poſition, to ſhoot Point Blank.</p>
               <p>And to make a good ſhot at a Mark, within Point-blank reach of the Piece, The Piece lying in that Poſition, as is before ſhewn; then ſet up your Diſpart upon the Muzzle; then if you put your Eye down to the higheſt part of the baſe Ring (as you took the Diameter of) and bring the top of the Diſpart in a righe-line, with the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61990:96"/>Object at a Diſtance, that ought to be of the ſame Heighth from the Horizon at your Breech of the Gun and the Diſpart, then is your Sight or viſual Line alſo parallel to the Horizon, and if there be nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in the Piece or Carriage, you will make a good Shot.</p>
               <p>But if you intend to elevate your Piece, diſcharge it of ſome of the Quoins at the Breech, and by your Quadrant applyed to the Muzzle, you may elevate the Piece to what Angle you pleaſe; as may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the New Sea Gunners Rule, whoſe Uſe is ſhewn at the latter End of this Book.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:61990:100"/>try with ſeveral Rammer-heads, until you find the Diameter of the Bore in that Place where the Shot uſeth to lye in the Piece, and a Shot of one twentieth part lower than that Place, is ſufficient.</p>

                  <head>How to make a Shot out of one Ship unto another in any Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatſoever.</head>
                  <p>IN time of ſervice when you are on a ſuddain to make a Shot at a Ship, and know not what diſpart will ſerve the Piece, then you muſt take your aim at what part of the Ship you judge to do moſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and look along by the ſide of the Piece, as near as you may at the middle of the Breech unto the middle of the Mouth of the Piece, and ſo place her to the beſt advantage, and quoin up the tayl of the Piece faſt (for that giveth the true height of the mark) Then minding the ſteeridge take your beſt opportunity and give fire, and if the Sea be any thing grown, chooſe your Piece that is neareſt the Main-Maſt and in the lower Teer, if the Ship can keep her Ports open, for there ſhe doth leaſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and when you are to make a Shot at a Ship, you muſt be ſure to have a good Helms-Man that can ſteer ſteady.</p>
                  <p>And he that giveth level muſt lay his Piece directly with that part of the Ship that he doth mean to ſhoot at. And if the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61990:104"/>Enemy be to Leeward of you, then give fire when the Ship doth begin to aſcend or rife upon a Sea, which is the beſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that doth preſent.</p>
                  <p>But if the Enemy is on the weather-gage of you, then wait an opportunity when the Ships do right themſelves; for if you ſhould give fire at the heelding of your Ship, then you would ſhoot over the other Ship; and if the Sea be high, there is no better time to give fire than when your Enemies Ship begins to riſe on the top of a Sea, for then you have a better mark than when ſhe is in the trough of the Sea: All which ſeveral obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations muſt be managed, with a good judgment and diſcretion of the Gunner.</p>
                  <p>And he that is at the Helm muſt be Yare-Handed with the Helm, to obſerve the motion of the Enemy, to luff when the Enemy luffs, and to bear up when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my bears up; and it is always good to level the Piece rather under the place you ſhoot at than over.</p>
                  <p>And if in a fight, if you intend to lay your Enemy, aboard then call up your Company either to enter or defend.</p>
                  <p>And if you are reſolved to enter, then be ſure to level your Baſes or other ſmall Guns ready to diſcharge to the beſt advantage you can at the firſt boarding, at ſuch a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:61990:104"/>place where his Men have moſt recourſe, and if you can poſſibly, at boarding endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to take off his Rudder by a great ſhot, or at his Main Maſt &amp;c.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>In what Order to place your great great Guns in Ships.</head>
                  <p>IT is firſt to be conſidered that the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be made in ſuch ſort that the Piece may lie right in the middle of the Port, and that the Trucks or Wheels are not too high, for if they are too high, then it will keep the carriage, that it will not go cloſe to the Ships ſide, ſo that by that means the Gun will not go far enough out of the Port, except the Piece be of a great length; and alſo if the Ships heelds that way, the Trucks will always run cloſe to the Ships ſide, ſo that if you have occaſion to make a ſhot, you ſhall not bring the Trucks off the Ships ſide, but that will run too again; and the Wheel or Trucks being too high, it is not a ſmall thing will ſtay it, but will run over it.</p>
                  <p>And another inconveniency is, if the Trucks are too high, it will cauſe the Piece to have a greater reverſe or recoyl, therefore
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61990:105"/>for theſe reaſons it is good to have low Wheels or Trucks to a Gun aboard of a Ship.</p>
                  <p>The beſt poſition that the Gun can be in is, to place it in the very midſt of the Port, that is to ſay, that the Piece lying level at point blank, and the Ship to be upright without any heelding, that it be as many Inches from the lower ſide of that Port beneath, as it is upon the upper part above; and the deeper or higher the Ports are up and down, it is the better for making of a ſhot, for the heelding of a Ship, whether it be on the Lee or Weather ſide; for if you have occaſion to ſhoot forward or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the ſteeridge of the Ship will ſerve the turn.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo very bad to have the Orlope or Deck too low under the Port, for then the Carriage muſt be made very high, which is very inconvenient in ſeveral reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, for in firing the Piece it is apt to overthrow, as alſo in the working and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring of the Ship in foul weather.</p>
                  <p>And alſo you have conſideration in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing your Ordinance in a Ship, for the ſhorteſt Ordinance is beſt to be placed out of the Ships ſide, for ſeveral reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the eaſe of the Ship, for the ſhorter they are the lighter, and if the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61990:105"/>Ship ſhould heel with the bearing of a Sail, then you muſt ſhut the Ports, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe Guns on the lower deck; then the ſhorter the Piece is, the eaſier it is to be taken in both for the ſhortneſs and weight alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In like manner, the ſhorter the Piece lyeth out of the Ships ſide, the leſs it ſhall annoy them in the tackling of the Ships Sails, for if the Piece lyeth far out the Sheets, Tacks or Bowlines, it will be apt to be foul of the Guns.</p>
                  <p>For your long Guns they are beſt to be placed in the Gun-Room or any place, after on for a Stern-Chaſe, for two Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Piece had need to be long, or elſe it will not go far enough out that it may be no annoyance to the works of the Stern that may over-hang, and ſo may blow away the Counter of the Ships Stern.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Pieces that are placed abaft, are required to be long, becauſe of the raking of the Ships Stern from below, ſo that the Carriages cannot come ſo near the Ports as they do by the Ships ſide, which is more up and down.</p>
                  <p>Alſo for ſuch like Reaſons as theſe, it is as well required to have long Pices to be placed forward or in the Fore-Caſtle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:61990:106"/>
                  <p>And here note that there muſt be regard had to the making of the Carriages, both for Forward-on or After-on for the places of the foremoſt trucks, in taking notice if the Ships ſide do tumble in or out, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the cumbering of the Deck or Orlope; in all theſe caſes it muſt be left to a good judgment and experience, in the convenient placing of Guns in a Ship.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. Of Powder. <hi>Several things neceſſary to be known by a Gunner; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Powder.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE efficient cauſe for expelling the Shot is the Fire that is made of Powder, that is compounded of Salt-Petre, Brimſtone and Charcoal.</p>
               <p>The Salt-Petre gives the Blow or Report.</p>
               <p>The Sulphur takes Fire, and the Coal rarifies the other two, to make them Fire the better.</p>
               <p>Two ſorts of Gun-Powder are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in uſe.</p>
               <p>One is made of five Parts of Salt-Petre, one of Brimſtone, and one part of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:61990:107"/>
               <p>The other (being ſtronger) is made of ſix one and one.</p>
               <p>That of five one and one is generally uſed for great Guns, the other for Muskets and ſmall Arms.</p>
               <p>And it hath been generally obſerved, that forty two pound of Powder of five one and one, is ſtronger than forty five pound of four one and one; and forty pound of ſix one and one works greater effect, than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two pound of five one and one, although all contain thirty pound of Salt-Petre.</p>
               <p>Anciently they made Powder of four one and one; but this Powder by experience being ſound too weak, is not now in uſe.</p>
               <p>That Powder which at this day is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into their Majeſties Magazine at the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> is made of ſix one and one.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>To know good Powder.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The harder the Corns are in feeling, by ſo much the better it is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the Powder is of a fair Azure or French Ruſſet colour, is it judged to be a very good ſort and to have all its Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents well wrought, and the Petre to be well refined.</p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:61990:108"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Lay five or ſix Corns upon a white piece of Paper three fingers diſtance one from another, then fire one, and if the Powder is good they will all fire at once and leave nothing but a white chalky co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour on the Paper; neither will the Paper be toucht: But if there remains a groſſneſs of Brimſtone and Petre, it diſcovers the Powder to be bad.</p>
                  <p>And take this for a general Rule, for a ſign of good Powder; that which gives fire ſooneſt, ſmoaks leaſt, and leaves leaſt ſign behind it, is the beſt ſort of Gun-Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                  <head>To preſerve Powder from decaying.</head>
                  <p>To preſerve good Powder, Gunners ought to have that reaſon to keep their Store in as dry a place that can be had in the Ship, and every Fortnight or three Weeks to turn all the Barrels and Cartridges upſide down, ſo that the Petre may be diſperſed to every part alike; for if it ſtands long, the Petre will always deſcend downwards, and if it be not well ſhak'd and moved, it will want of its ſtrength at the top, and 1 <hi>l.</hi> at bottom with long ſtanding will be ſtronger then 3 at the top.</p>

                  <p>TO find the ſtrength of Guns the brief Rule is thus, Firſt find the Diameter of the bore (or Chamber of the Gun) where the ſhot lies, then the true fortified Iron Guns ought to be 11 of thoſe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters in the circumference of the Gun at the Touch-hole, 9 at the Trunions, and 7 at the Neck, a little behind the Mouth or Muzzle-ring where the diſpart is ſet.</p>

After you have doubled the Shells, paſt on ſome at a time, and let it dry, and put ſome more until it be quite full; then dip it in ſcalding Roſſen or Pitch and hang it up and it is for your uſe: But you muſt have the innermoſt end of the Twine left out, and before you pitch it you muſt draw out the Twine and ſtop the hole, and then pitch it.</p>

A Gunner ought to be a ſober, wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, luſty, patient, prudent and quick Spirited Man; he ought alſo to have a good eye-ſight and a good judgment in the time of ſervice, ſo to plant his Piece to do moſt hurt or execution, either to the Hull or rigging of a Ship, as may be moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient according to the appoinment of the Commander.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:61990:113"/>
               <p n="2">2. A Gunner ought to be skilful in Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick and Geometry, in the making of all kind of Artificial Fire-Works, eſpecially for ſervice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Gunner ought to procure with all his power the Friendſhip and Love of every Perſon, and to take great care of his charge for his own ſafety as well as the Ship and all the Mens lives, by having ſpecial regard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Powder Room and to be well ſatisfied in the carefulneſs of thoſe that he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt to manage the buſineſs there, and to ſee that the Yeoman is careful always to keep a good and large Lanthorn, and to be kept whole, that it may prevent the flying in of the duſt of the Powder, for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of which it hath ſometimes been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that ſome Ships have been blown up and loſt for want of care in the Powder Room.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A Gunner ought at the receipt of his charge, to make an Inventory of all ſuch things as ſhall be committed to him, as well to render an account as to conſider the want of ſuch Materials as are neceſſary to the well performance of his duty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Gunner ought to have his Gun-Room always ready furniſhed with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries belonging to his Art, which ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be in readineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> Ladles, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61990:113"/>Spunges, Gun-Powder, Balls, Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, Wadds, Chain-ſhot, Croſs-bar-ſhot, Quoins, Crows, Tackles, Breechings, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Horns, Canvaſs, and Paper for Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridges, Forms for Ladles, Cartridges, Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and Threed to ſow and bind the Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridges, Candles, Lanthorns, Handſpikes, Poleaxes, little Hand-Baskets, Glew and Paſt, with a ſufficient Crew of able and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Seamen, being yare-handed to travers a Piece, to Charge, Diſcharge, Mount, Wadd, Ram, make Clean, Spunge, and Prime and Scoure, and readily to do and perform any thing belonging to the Practical Part of Gunnery.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Gunner ought always to have a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler about him, and a pair of Compaſſes, and Callabers to meaſure the heighth and length of every part of his concavity, and the length depth and wideneſs of every Ladle whereby he may know whether his Piece is laden with too much Powder, or is charged with a leſs quantity than it ought to have.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A Gunner ought to know the length and weight of all manner of Pieces, and be able to give an account readily how much Powder is a due charge for every Piece, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times a Piece may be ſhot off without harm, and how each kind of Piece ſhould be charged with the Powder, Tamkin, Ball and Wadd.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:61990:114"/>
               <p n="8">8. A Gunner alſo muſt be skilful to make Salt-Petre, to refine and ſublime Salt-Petre, to make divers ſorts of Gun-Powder to purifie Brimſtone, to amend any ſort of Powder when it hath loſt its vertue and force, and to know how much Salt-Petre ought to be put to the ſaid unſerviceable Powder, and to make it ſtrong as it was before, and how many times the Salt-Petre that is put into the Powder ought to be refined.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A Gunner that ſerves at Sea muſt be careful to ſee that all their great Ordance be faſt breeched, and that all the furniture be handſome and in a readineſs as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that they are circumſpect about their Powder in the time of ſervice, and to have an eſpecial care of the Linſtocks and Candles for fear of their Powder and their Fire-works, and the Oacum, which is very dangerous, and to keep your Pieces (as neer as you can within): And alſo that you keep their Touch-holes clean without any kind of droſs falling in them; and it is good for the Gunner to view his Pieces and to know their perfect diſpart, and to mark it upon the Piece or elſe in a Book or Table, and name every Piece what it is and where ſhe doth lie in the Ship, and note how many inches halfs and quarters of inches the diſpart cometh unto.</p>

               <p>As the firſt Number given, is to the ſecond Number given, ſo is the third Number gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to the fourth Number required: Or as the firſt Number given, is to the third Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber given, ſo is the ſecond Number given, to the fourth Number Required.</p>
               <p>Therefore, always extend the Compaſſes from the firſt Number to the ſecond, and that diſtance or extent applyed the ſame way upon the Line, ſhall reach from the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61990:123"/>third to the fourth Number required. Or otherwiſe extend the Compaſſes from the firſt Number to the third, and that extent applied the ſame way ſhall alſo reach from the ſecond to the fourth. Either of theſe ways will effect the ſame things; and it is neceſſary thus to vary the Proportion, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to avoid the opening of the Compaſſes too wide, for when the Compaſſes are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a very large extent, you can neither take off any Diſtance exactly, nor give ſo good an Eſtimate of any parts required, as you may do when they are opened to a leſſer diſtance: But this you will find out beſt by Practice and therefore I will now proceed to examples.</p>
